weather Trend assessment
The project focuses on analyzing global weather trends using a dataset named GlobalWeatherRepository.csv. The dataset contains various weather-related attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, air quality, and more, collected from different locations around the world. The goal of the project is to explore, clean, and analyze this dataset to uncover patterns and trends in weather conditions globally.

Key Steps in the Project
Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The dataset is loaded using the pandas library, and the first few rows are displayed to get an initial understanding of the data.

The dataset contains 41 columns, including attributes like country, location_name, latitude, longitude, temperature_celsius, temperature_fahrenheit, condition_text, and various air quality metrics.

Handling Missing Values

The dataset is checked for missing values using df.isna().sum().

Missing values in numerical columns are filled with the mean of the respective columns, while missing values in categorical columns are filled with the mode.

After handling missing values, the dataset is checked again to ensure no missing values remain.

Outlier Detection and Removal

Outliers in the numerical data are detected using the Z-score method.

Rows with Z-scores greater than 3 are considered outliers and removed from the dataset to ensure the analysis is not skewed by extreme values.

Data Encoding

Categorical variables such as country, location_name, condition_text, and timezone are encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models.

This step is crucial as machine learning algorithms typically require numerical input.

Feature Correlation Analysis

A correlation heatmap is generated using seaborn to visualize the relationships between different numerical features.

The heatmap helps in identifying features that are highly correlated, which can be useful for feature selection in predictive modeling.

Data Sampling and Visualization

Due to the large size of the dataset, a sample of 500 rows is taken for visualization purposes.

A heatmap of the correlation matrix is plotted to provide a clear visual representation of the relationships between different weather attributes.

Insights and Findings
Temperature Trends: The analysis reveals a strong correlation between temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, which is expected since they are different units of the same measurement.

Air Quality: There is a noticeable correlation between different air quality metrics, such as air_quality_PM2.5 and air_quality_PM10, indicating that areas with high particulate matter in the air tend to have poor air quality overall.

Geographical Patterns: The dataset includes geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), which can be used to map weather patterns and identify regions with extreme weather conditions.

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global weather trends by cleaning, encoding, and visualizing the dataset. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to build predictive models for weather forecasting, understand the impact of air quality on health, and identify regions that may require environmental interventions.

Future Work
Predictive Modeling: Future work could involve building machine learning models to predict weather conditions based on historical data.

Geospatial Analysis: Using the geographical coordinates, geospatial analysis can be performed to visualize weather patterns on a map.

Time Series Analysis: Analyzing how weather conditions change over time could provide deeper insights into climate trends.

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in understanding complex environmental data and can serve as a foundation for more advanced studies in climate science and meteorology.
